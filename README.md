# 2d-pixel-art-template

For Godot 3.

I couldn't find a template for this on the asset library so here's mine.

**Defaults:**
* Window size of 480x270
* Test size of 960x540
* Stretch mode Viewport
* Stretch aspect Expand
* Import default set to 2D Pixel
* GPU Pixel Snap on
* Font Oversampling off

Additional tip: You can go into Editor -> Manage Editor Features to create a profile with only the nodes you need. This way you can stop 3D nodes from showing up when you create new nodes.
